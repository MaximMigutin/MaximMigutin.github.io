# Dockerized Recommender system 

* This project was created as a follow-up wrapper for the paper that I prepared for the 2020 Lomonosov Conference "Economic overview of 2020s":     https://lomonosov-msu.ru/rus/event/6500/page/1743   
* To sum up, the end result of this research is a matrix factorisation-based recommender system for retail goods built on Flask and wrapped into a Docker container.
