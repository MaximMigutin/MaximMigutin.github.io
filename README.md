## Personal Website
In my personal website I give an overview of my professional experience, academic background, areas of interest and other things that I find fascinating. 

I used a Jekyll template created by [Youssef Raafat](https://youssefraafatnasry.github.io/portfolYOU/docs#installation).

If you want to create your own personal webpage similar to this one, simply fork my (or his) repository and, in your terminal, use 
`bundle exec jekyll serve` to see the website launch on your localhost:4000.
