# **Education**
My academic journey hasn't finished yet and probably never will, as I'm always eager to acquire new skills and learn new things both in my professional field of Data Science and about the world in general. However, in this section I try to give a brief overview of my 6-year formal education path.
During my staudies I met wonderful mentors and got interested in various areas of study & research which led me to altering my overall vector of personal development.
I took part in <font color="#CD6A65"><b>four</b></font> academic programs in <font color="#CD6A65"><b>three</b></font> diferent countries, from which only 1 was an exchange program.
As of now, I continue to deepen my knowledge using various e-study platforms like Coursera & Udemy and also join offline formal training programs from time to time.
